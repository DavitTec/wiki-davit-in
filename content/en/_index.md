# Welcome to the Documentation

DAVIt is a customised Linux distribution organisation focused on impoverished communities, building on Linux (with plans for Arch distributions and others). It provides an intuitive operating system for users unfamiliar with information technology, including laptops, desktops, smartphones, and online accounts.

Our goal is to empower new users and trainers in regions like Ghana through simple tools, a [Learning Management System](/lms/) (LMS) framework, and branded packages in "/opt/davit".

## Feature Overview

- **Traditional Yet Modern**: Supports new technologies while keeping a simple, familiar interface.
- **Light and Fast**: Optimised for low-end hardware common in Africa.
- **Easy Customisation**: Tweak settings via "/opt/davit" configure.
- **Sane Defaults**: Beginner-friendly for those new to computers.
- **Good Documentation**: Tutorials for basic IT awareness and OS use.
- **Easy Accessibility**: Built-in support for diverse users.
